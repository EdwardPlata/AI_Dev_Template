# Example: Using Claude Code

This file demonstrates how to interact with Claude Code for various development tasks.

## Code Explanation

Ask Claude to explain complex code:
```
"Can you explain how this authentication flow works?"
"What design patterns are used in this module?"
```

## Refactoring

Ask Claude to refactor code:
```
"Refactor this function to use async/await"
"Convert this class to use TypeScript"
"Improve the error handling in this code"
```

## Code Generation

Ask Claude to generate code:
```
"Create a REST API endpoint for user registration"
"Write unit tests for this function"
"Generate a Dockerfile for this Node.js application"
```

## Debugging

Ask Claude to help debug:
```
"Why is this function returning undefined?"
"Help me fix this memory leak"
"What's wrong with this SQL query?"
```

## Documentation

Ask Claude to help with documentation:
```
"Write JSDoc comments for this module"
"Generate a README for this project"
"Create API documentation from this code"
```

## Best Practices

1. **Provide Context**: Include relevant code and explain what you're trying to achieve
2. **Be Specific**: Ask clear, focused questions
3. **Iterate**: Refine Claude's suggestions through follow-up questions
4. **Verify**: Always test and review Claude's generated code
5. **Learn**: Use Claude's explanations to improve your understanding

## Example Conversation

```
You: "Here's a function that's running slowly. Can you optimize it?"

[Paste your function]

Claude: [Analyzes the function and suggests optimizations]

You: "That's great! Can you also add error handling?"

Claude: [Adds error handling to the optimized version]

You: "Perfect! Now can you write tests for this?"

Claude: [Generates comprehensive test cases]
```
